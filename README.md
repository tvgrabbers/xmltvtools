Tools for manipulating xmltv listings

At present all it can do is remove or add HDTV tags, either replacing the original listing or adding a new one with "-sd" or "-hd" added to the xmltvID.  
If you have any wishes please open an issue. Within the framework other manipulations are easily added.

Next to this commandline tool I'm thinking about/working at a viewer that maybe later will expand to an editor.
